// Static registry of rover scripts for the Free Roam mode dropdown.
//
// Bob's authoring workflow:
//   1. Write the script JSON to specs/scripts/<kebab-case-name>.json
//   2. Copy the same JSON to services/client/src/specs/scripts/<kebab-case-name>.json
//   3. Add an import and entry below so the script appears in the dropdown
